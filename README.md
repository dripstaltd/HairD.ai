# HairD.ai
Hair scanner and colour advice for at-home or salon dyeing.



## Description
Hairdai helps users make realistic and informed decisions when choosing to dye their hair at home or have it professionally colored in a salon. The app's results are based on a single dye session and tailored to each user's unique hair.

Users start by uploading 20 photos of their hair in its current state. They can then choose one of two options:
Select a color they want to achieve.
Explore available options for their hair.
Additional questions, such as "Is your hair already dyed?" help refine the results.
Hairdai generates personalized advice to guide users on their hair-coloring journey. Whether you're planning to dye at home or consult a stylist, Hairdai ensures you're prepared.

Extra Feature: Users could view their hair with the chosen hair colour changed in the image.

*Disclaimer -> Always consult with a professional hairstylist. Hairdai is a guide, but skilled professionals can sometimes achieve results beyond the app's recommendationsâ€”often at a higher cost or over multiple sessions.*

## MVP
Users should be able to upload photos of their current hair state and receive tailored hair color advice or realistic options for achieving their desired look.
